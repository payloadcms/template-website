## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

## Access Control

## Preview

## ISR

## Nested Docs

## Layout Builder

## SEO

## Development

### Seed

To seed the database with a few products and pages you can run `yarn seed`.

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.
